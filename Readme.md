# Calculator Project

## Overview

This project is a Java-based calculator application with both standard and scientific functionalities. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing various arithmetic and scientific calculations.

## Project Structure

- `Main.java`: The entry point of the application.
- `calculatrice/Clavier.java`: Defines the buttons and their properties for the calculator.
- `calculatrice/Calc.java`: Implements the main functionality of the calculator, including event handling and operations.

## Features

- **Standard Mode**: Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Mode**: Advanced operations including trigonometric functions, logarithms, factorials, and base conversions (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal).
- **GUI**: Built using Swing components for a user-friendly interface.
